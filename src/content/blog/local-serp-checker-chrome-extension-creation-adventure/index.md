🚀✨💻 When I first had the idea to develop a Chrome extension, I didn't even fully understand how it could be possible. However, in a world intertwined with technology, particularly in digital marketing and SEO, I needed a practical tool to quickly view local search results. This is where my story began, leading me to create the "Local SERP Checker" extension. But I wasn't alone on this journey—I had a powerful assistant by my side: Artificial Intelligence, specifically ChatGPT.

## How Did the Need Arise? 🌍🔍🕵️‍♂️

In SEO, we often need to see where our websites rank in Google searches from different cities or countries. Doing this manually was cumbersome and incredibly time-consuming. Moreover, obtaining accurate results was challenging since Google search results continuously change based on the user's location. To overcome this issue, I asked myself: "Can I create a tool to simplify this process?" The answer lay hidden in the world of Chrome Extensions, a field I didn't initially know but was determined to explore.

## First Steps Powered by AI 🤖👨‍💻🚧

I already knew artificial intelligence could greatly assist me in daily tasks, but I never imagined it would be so helpful in developing a Chrome extension. I explained my idea to ChatGPT, and our journey began.

First, I learned how to create a manifest file, which would allow Chrome to recognize and properly operate my extension.

Next, we proceeded to build HTML and JavaScript code. ChatGPT guided me consistently after writing the initial draft, helping me identify and fix bugs and missing parts effectively.

In the first version of the extension, users could open searches for selected keywords in specific locations.

We then advanced to creating v2, a more sophisticated version. Now, users could determine the ranking position of specific domains within Google's search results.

Significant improvements were also made to the user interface. We enhanced user experience by adding loading animations and informative result boxes, making the waiting process more enjoyable and informative.

💡🛠️📚 One of the most fascinating parts of the development was my continuous interaction with ChatGPT to overcome technical challenges.
